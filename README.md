# Workout Stats

Garmin watches have a pretty good interface for recording strength training workouts.
However, it gets pretty clunky when you try to look through your past workouts or analyze
any of the data.

Workout Stats provides a user interface that lets you upload your Garmin strength
workouts and surfaces insights on your training progress, latest activities, etc.

Pretty much all of the code lives in the [workout-stats-frontend directory](workout-stats-frontend).

The UI is hosted on [https://workout.love](https://workout.love)

Note that currently this UI is meant to be used in concert with the
[Garmin Workout Downloader](https://github.com/labsansis/garmin-workout-downloader)
browser extension.
